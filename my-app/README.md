This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This uses the app folder, with a sample notes that runs on the client side using contextAPI on the notes page.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001) with your browser to see the result.


About the app routes:

the app/items uses ContextAPI (Client Side Rendering)
the app/categories uses React Redux (Client Side Rendering)
the pages/customers uses Server Side Rendering for the customers index page
